    <e style="size: 23px; font-weight: bold;">Why is this site created? <br> <br>   
        Youtube Community posts — who doesn't know that place? <br> Your thoughts are forced to obey the community guidelines.
         <br>  Guidelines that aren't 100% wrong actually,
        <br> but oftentimes silenced critiques of the tyrant, especially when we use informal languages. <br> <br>
        We can't stay silent about this. <br>
        We will not obey. <br>
        We will create an alternative. <br> <br>
        At last, we finally took our voice back — by creating this site.
         <br>
         Here, we are free writing our thoughts down without any oppression. No authority, no masters, no tyrant.
          <br> <br> This is Total Liberation. <br> <br>
        Important to note: most writings are made by an amateur. <br>So if there's inconsistent 
        writing, mistaken or inappropriate, sincerest apologies we please. <br> <br> </e>
