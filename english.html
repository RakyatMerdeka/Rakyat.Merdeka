        1. The main point of Leninism is to adjust Marx's communism according to the current situation of semi-feudal Russia, <br> he (Lenin) thought that instead of waiting
    the workers to be educated politically, it will be better to create a highly disciplined party, filled with people who understand communism really well, and they will 
    lead the workers to the communist society. <br> Vanguard Party is established. <br> <br>

    2. The core problem is: with the establishment of vanguard party, Lenin indirectly <br>
    shattered the people into two classes; the politically enlightened one, and the politically
    immature one. <br> This is extremely dangerous because it closes mass 
    participation and it will create distances between the party and the people.
